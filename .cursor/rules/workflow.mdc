# Development Workflow

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
2. Start the development server with `yarn dev`
3. Run tests with `yarn test` or `yarn test:watch`

## Development Process

- Start by understanding requirements
- Create or modify components in the appropriate directory
- Add necessary types in [src/types/](mdc:src/types/)
- Implement functionality with proper hooks
- Add tests for new components or features
- Ensure responsive design works on all target devices

## Code Review Guidelines

- Ensure code follows project conventions
- Check for TypeScript errors and proper typing
- Verify component reusability and separation of concerns
- Test for edge cases and error states
- Validate accessibility compliance
- Review performance implications

## Build and Deployment

- Run `yarn build` to create production build
- Verify build output works as expected
- Follow deployment process for target environment

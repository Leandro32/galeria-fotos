# Dual Implementation Structure

This project contains two implementations of the photo gallery application:

## 1. React + Vite Implementation

The primary implementation is built with React 19 and Vite, located in the [src/](mdc:src/) directory. This version uses:

- React Router for navigation
- Direct import of Radix UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## 2. Next.js Implementation

A parallel implementation using Next.js is located in the [photogallery/](mdc:photogallery/) directory. This version:

- Uses the Next.js App Router
- Has its own component structure
- Shares similar styling approach with Tailwind CSS

## Purpose

The dual implementation allows for:
1. Comparison between different React frameworks
2. Exploration of different routing strategies
3. Demonstration of component reusability across frameworks

When working on features, consider which implementation you're targeting, as the file structure and imports will differ between the two.
